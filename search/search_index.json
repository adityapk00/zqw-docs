Android App FAQ What is a direct connection vs Allow connections over the internet via ZecWallet wormhole When your phone and your desktop are on the same network (eg. on your home network), your phone can directly reach your desktop over your local network (if there are no firewalls blocking the connection). In this scenario, your phone directly communicates with your desktop ZecWallet. This is the default. If your phone is on a different network (if you re connected via 4G/LTE, for example) or if your desktop ZecWallet is behind a firewall, your phone can t directly reach your desktop. In this scenario, your phone and desktop both connect to a service run by ZecWallet (called wormhole.zecqtwallet.com), which routes information between your phone and your desktop. How can I ensure that only direct connections are enabled? This is already the default. If you want to connect over the internet via wormhole.zecqtwallet.com, you will need to opt-in by checking the Connect over internet via ZecWallet wormhole checkbox on the connection page. You can also disable connecting over the internet via ZecWallet wormhole in the Android app s settings. What data can the wormhole service see? All communication is encrypted end-to-end, so the wormhole service can t see the content of your messages. It can see some meta-data like the IP addresses and date/timestamps. Both your phone and your desktop connect to wormhole.zecqtwallet.com over HTTPS. Will it always connect via the wormhole service? The Android app will first attempt a direct connection each time you open the App. If a direct connection is not possible, it will then attempt to connect via wormhole (if enabled). How can I connect over the internet without using the wormhole service? You ll need to install a VPN on your home network, so you can VPN into your network from 4G/LTE networks, and then connect directly to your node. For example, you can use a service such as Pi VPN .

ZecWallet is available to download from the Zcash Foundation GitHub repository . The releases page lists the latest available downloads for each platform. The Android application, which is still in beta, may be downloaded from here . Which version should I download? See the installation section for more details specific for your platform. How do I verify the download file? Starting from v0.5.10 all ZecWallet releases are signed. You may download the detached signatures on the releases page and verify that the software was signed with the published public key . In addition, each release contains SHA256 checksums that may additionally be verified. For more information, see the Verifying the download section of the Installation guide . Blockchain Is ZecWallet a light client? No, ZecWallet requires a full zcashd node to operate. A light client protocol is currently in development that would substantially reduce the storage and bandwidth requirements for a light wallet. Currently, to use shielded transactions, you need to run a full node. How large is the blockchain? Currently, the blockchain data directory is around 22GB (Feb 2019) and will continue to grow over time. Can I change the location of the data directory? If you are starting ZecWallet for the first time, then you can choose the Advanced Config option and select the desired location of your data directory, which may, for example, be on a separate disk. If you have an existing data directory you would like to move, you can achieve this through the following steps, with ZecWallet closed: Create the new directory. Move everything in your existing data directory to the new location with the exception of zcash.conf which must remain in the original data directory location. Update zcash.conf to add the line datadir=/your/new/path specifying the path to the newly created folder. Restart ZecWallet. Can I move the params directory? No, unlike the data directory there is no configurable option to specify the params directory and zcashd expects the params directory to be in the following locations: Windows: %HOMEPATH%\\AppData\\Roaming\\ZcashParams macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams Linux: ~/.zcash-params The folder should contain the following files and all are (currently) required for zcashd to function. 3.5M sapling-output.params 46M sapling-spend.params 692M sprout-groth16.params 869M sprout-proving.key 1.5K sprout-verifying.key As a workaround, you can use any filesystem operations for your OS, e.g. creating a symlink of the directory, but these are unsupported. Transactions Can I use funds with zero confirmations? No, Zcash requires that you have at least 1 confirmation before sending. Trying to spend unconfirmed funds will result in an error . Can I use a custom fee? Yes, though it is advised to use the default 0.0001 fee to prevent your transactions from being distinguishable, you may override this behaviour in the app Options . What s the difference between Transparent, Sprout and Sapling addresses? Transparent addresses start with a t prefix and are transparent like Bitcoin and offer no privacy properties. Sprout addresses have a zc prefix and are the first generation of shielded addresses. Sprout addresses have been superseded by Sapling addresses which have a zs prefix. While Sprout addresses may still be used, it is recommended to use Sapling addresses due to the performance improvements and updated system parameters. To move funds between Sprout and Sapling addresses see the turnstile migration documentation . For more detailed information on the types of addresses in Zcash see this page . Note that on testnet, transparent addresses have a prefix tm , Sprout have a zt prefix and Sapling ztestsapling . How long does a Sapling transaction take? Sapling greatly reduced the time taken to perform shielded proofs down to just a few seconds though this value does depend on hardware and the number of shielded inputs/outputs. Sending from a transparent address to a Sapling one is typically completed in under 0.5 seconds. Legacy Sprout transactions take in the order of 70-90 seconds but this is also dependent on hardware and the number of JoinSplits. For more information see this post . zcashd node Where is the default data directory on each platform? By default, the location of the data directory, which stores the wallet, zcash.conf and all blockchain data, is found in the following locations. It is possible to move this data directory . Windows: %HOMEPATH%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Zcash macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Zcash Linux: ~/.zcash Where is zcash.conf located? zcash.conf is located in the default data directory and will be in this location even if the datadir parameter has been set to a custom value. Can I use ZecWallet with an external node? Yes, see this section for how to connect to an external zcashd . How do I find the version of zcashd that I am running? To find the version of zcashd you are running simply hover over the blockchain data in the lower right-hand corner and a popup will appear with the zcashd version string: Does ZecWallet work on testnet? Yes, ZecWallet will work on testnet. To do so add the following lines to your zcash.conf file, replacing the existing values if present: addnode = testnet.z.cash testnet = 1 Does ZecWallet support payment disclosure? Not yet. While payment disclosure works on Sprout addresses, zcashd has not yet been updated to support Sapling. There is a plan to support this once implemented by zcashd . Does ZecWallet support viewing keys? Not yet, as zcashd doesn\u2019t currently support Sapling viewing keys and will be implemented in ZecWallet once supported. How do I use the zcash-cli command? You may interact with the Zcash Payment API via RPC calls using the Zcash command line interface. You may wish to do this to enable advanced functionality or to debug issues outside of the ZecWallet interface. See this page for an overview of the Zcash RPC commands available. To use, follow the instructions for using the zcash-cli stop command simply replacing stop with the command you wish to run. For example, to query the detail of a completed shielded transaction on a Mac you would run: /Applications/zecwallet.app/Contents/MacOS/zcash-cli z_getoperationresult Wallet Is the wallet encrypted? No, wallet encryption is currently disabled by zcashd . You should use full-disk encryption (or encryption of your home directory) to protect your wallet.dat file at rest, and should assume (even unprivileged) users who are running on your OS can read your wallet.dat file. Why does my change go to a new address? Like Bitcoin, when using transparent addresses, change from a transaction goes to a new transparent address. ZecWallet allows you to set an option to automatically send this change to a Sapling address via the application Options . As the feature was added in Bitcoin as a measure to preserve privacy and prevent trivial linking of transactions on the blockchain, shielded (z) addresses do not have this property and any change is returned to the sending (z) address by default. Will ZecWallet remember my outgoing shielded sends? Yes, by default ZecWallet will store shielded sends locally as zcashd does not provide this information. You can override this behaviour via the Options setting and you can remove any stored transactions at any time by choosing the Clear History button (note that these will not be later recoverable if you delete them). How do I read a memo? If there is a memo attached to a transaction then it will be visible by a message icon in the transaction listing. Simply right-click the transaction and choose View Memo to read its encrypted contents. Can I use ZecWallet with a hardware wallet? No, this is currently not supported. Can I remove an address from the wallet? No, addresses cannot be removed from the wallet. It is advised that you export the private keys for addresses you are interested in and then delete the wallet.dat file. You can then import the private keys you require in a fresh, empty wallet. Seed phrases Can I import private keys from a recovery phrase / BIP39 Mnemonic? No, ZecWallet cannot import private keys from a recovery phrase directly. To do so you will need to extract your private keys from the recovery phrase. You can use a tool such as https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ entering the BIP39 Mnemonic (your recovery phrase) and choosing Zcash as the coin. Once you have entered these values look for the section entitled Derived Addresses which will list all the derived addresses and private keys for those addresses. You will need to import the private keys for any transparent addresses where you have funds, remembering that change in transparent addresses goes to a new address . Be very careful with your recovery seed Access to your recovery seed allows anyone to steal all of your Zcash. Though the tool listed above runs locally in your browser and is fully open source, you can always save the HTML file and run on an airgapped offline device for extra security. Can I export a BIP39 seed phrase? No, this is not supported. Can I export the Sapling HD seed? Sapling does implement an HD wallet however at present the only way to extract this is to perform the z_exportwallet command via zcashd and is unsupported in ZecWallet due to needing to write to an export directory. To extract the Sapling HD seed you need to run zcash-cli z_exportwallet after specifying an exportdir in zcash.conf . See these instructions for more details on working with the Zcash RPC CLI. Can I import the Sapling HD seed? Not at present, however, this feature will be added when supported by zcashd . Can I mine with ZecWallet? No, ZecWallet is a wallet and full node. While you can configure zcashd to run the built-in CPU miner, this isn t practical to run on mainnet and you need alternative hardware and software to run. See this page for more information on mining. WinZEC How do I upgrade from WinZEC / zcash4mac / zcash4win? WinZEC and its predecessor zcash4win (and zcash4mac) have now been deprecated. You can simply install ZecWallet and it ll use the existing data directory and wallet from any previous installation and operate as normal. Can I import the WinZEC address book? Yes, in the Address Book click to Import Address Book and browse to the location of the WinZEC address book file. By default this will be %HOMEPATH%\\AppData\\Local\\ZcashSwingWalletUI\\addressBook.csv where %/HOMEPATH% is typically C:\\Users\\username\\ and you may need to enable viewing hidden files to browse to the AppData folder location. In what languages is ZecWallet available? Currently, it is available in French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. If you want to help by translating see the Translating ZecWallet page. Why are there references to both zec-qt-wallet as well as ZecWallet? ycashfoundation/ycash/blob/master/src/chainparams.cpp The original wallet was named zec-qt-wallet and was renamed in March 2019 to ZecWallet so any references to the wallet before that date will use the zec-qt-wallet name. The previous name of zec-qt-wallet may remain in places where updating would cause issues with signing releases and upgrades. Ycash What is Ycash? Ycash is a friendly-fork of the Zcash blockchain that activates at block height 570,000. You can learn more on the Ycash Foundation s website How do I claim my Ycash? After the Ycash fork, you ll be able to claim your YEC on the Ycash Blockchain if you have control of your private keys. If you re a ZecWallet user, you can use the following process: Wait for block 570,000 Make a note of the Zcash addresses that contain funds that you want to claim on Ycash. Create new Zcash address(s) and move your funds to the new address. Export your private keys for the old zcash addresses that you noted down in Step 2 from File - Export All Private Keys Download and install Ycash Import your private keys into Ycash/YecWallet. You ll have to wait for the rescan to complete, which might take serveral hours to see your YEC. Do I need to do something special in ZecWallet to protect myself? Ycash implements 2-way replay protection, and in addition has different address formats to prevent funds from either chain from being accidentally sent to the wrong address. There is some concern over a privacy leak via related nullifiers . To be super safe, you should send your shielded funds on Ycash to yourself before you spend them. How do I find out what my Ycash address is? You can use this online tool to convert between Zcash and Ycash addresses .","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"faq/#where-do-i-download-the-software","text":"ZecWallet is available to download from the Zcash Foundation GitHub repository .

The file is located in the data directory and by default is found in the following locations: Windows: %HOMEPATH%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Zcash\\debug.log macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Zcash/debug.log Linux: ~/.zcash/debug.log If you have specified a custom datadir option then the debug.log file will be located in that directory. Using a tool such as tail you can view the last 100 lines with the following command: tail -n 100 ~/.zcash/debug.log On Windows %HOMEPATH% is typically C:\\Users\\username where username is your username. The zec-qt-wallet.log file As with the debug.log file, the zec-qt-wallet.log file will help to identify issues with the ZecWallet application. Providing the latest output of this file can help in troubleshooting issues. The location of this file is in the following location for each platform: Windows: %HOMEPATH%\\AppData\\Roaming\\zec-qt-wallet-org\\zec-qt-wallet\\zec-qt-wallet.log macOS: /Users/gareth/Library/Application Support/zec-qt-wallet-org/zec-qt-wallet/zec-qt-wallet.log Linux: ~/.local/share/zec-qt-wallet-org/zec-qt-wallet/zec-qt-wallet.log My node isn t syncing or is slow to sync If your node isn t syncing or is slow to sync, first check that you are running the latest version of ZecWallet then check that you have connections to other nodes as you may have a network issue. ZecWallet will display if you are connected via the application footer. You can also find this information in the zcashd tab on the main menu (if you are running the embedded zcashd ) and it will list the number of connections to other peers, which should be greater than 0. If you do not have any connections then check your internet connection, then check that the ports required for zcashd are not blocked and that you have not specified a TOR connection in the options but do not have TOR running. If you are still having issues, then look in the debug log to identify any error messages. The speed of syncing is dependent on a number of variables such as memory, CPU and bandwidth as blocks are also verified in addition to being downloaded. zcashd ports By default zcashd runs on the following ports. 8232 for mainnet RPC 8233 for mainnet peer-to-peer network 18232 for testnet RPC 18233 for testnet peer-to-peer network You may override any of these values in zcash.conf . My transaction didn t get mined If you send a transaction before the node is fully synced, or perhaps due to network congestion then the transaction may fail and be returned to your wallet due to the Transaction Expiry feature. When a user submits a transaction to the network, by default it will persist in the mempool for 20 blocks (currently approximately 50 minutes). If it has not been mined after that period, it is no longer valid and will be evicted from all mempools. The value will return to the sender\u2019s wallet. zcashd has no connections See the section on syncing issues for common resolutions to this issue. I can t generate a new shielded (z) address When the wallet is first launched, and before it has synced, the Sprout New Address button is greyed out, and it is not possible to generate a new shielded address. Sprout addresses have been deprecated in ZecWallet to encourage the use of Sapling ones. The ability to create Sapling addresses is only displayed in ZecWallet once the Sapling activation height is reached (block 419200). If you need to generate a new shielded address before the wallet has synced you may do so directly from the command line interface using the z_getnewaddress (Sapling) or z_getnewaddress sprout (legacy Sprout). Some of my shielded transactions are not displayed in the transaction tab By default, zcashd does not store outgoing shielded transactions. To overcome this, ZecWallet will store shielded sends locally and this option may be disabled and any saved transactions cleared. If you are missing any outgoing shielded transactions check that the option to Remember shielded transactions is selected in the wallet options . There is no way (currently) of recovering the information about outgoing fully shielded spends if this option is disabled. Sending from Sprout address to Sapling gives an error You cannot send directly from a Sprout address (zc) to a Sapling address (zs) as it must pass through the Sapling turnstile . See the details on the turnstile migration for details on how to move your funds from a Sprout address to a Sapling one in a privacy-preserving way. How to perform a wallet rescan Potentially slow wallet rescan Depending on the number of addresses in your wallet (particularly shielded addresses) a wallet rescan can be slow. Simply leave it running until the process is complete. Embedded zcashd If you are using the embedded zcashd (There is a zcashd tab in ZecWallet), you can go to Edit - Settings - Troubleshooting and select the rescan option and click apply. You ll need to restart ZecWallet to start the rescan. Via an external zcashd If you are running the external zcashd you will need to restart zcashd after shutting down ZecWallet. With ZecWallet closed open a terminal/command prompt and run the following command depending on your platform (and adjust accordingly to match your system if required). Windows (installer): cmd /C \"\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\zecwallet\\zcashd.exe\" -rescan\" Windows (binaries): zcashd.exe -rescan from the directory of the downloaded binaries. macOS: /Applications/zecwallet.app/Contents/MacOS/zcashd -rescan Linux (deb): zcashd -rescan Linux (binaries): ./zcashd -rescan from the directory of the downloaded binaries. Then open ZecWallet and it should connect to the running zcashd and you can monitor the progress of the rescan on the startup screen. Note that the command above will open an instance of zcashd in the foreground, you can change this behaviour by adding the -daemon option. You will need to manually stop zcashd as ZecWallet will not close an externally running node. The simplest method is to run the zcash-cli stop command: Windows (installer): cmd /C \"\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\zecwallet\\zcash-cli.exe\" stop\" Windows (binaries): zcash-cli.exe stop from the directory of the downloaded binaries. macOS: /Applications/zecwallet.app/Contents/MacOS/zcash-cli stop Linux (deb): zcash-cli stop Linux (binaries): ./zcash-cli stop from the directory of the downloaded binaries. Editing zcash.conf As an alternative to the external zcashd you can edit the zcash.conf file and add the line rescan=1 and then start ZecWallet normally. After you have opened ZecWallet and the rescan is complete you must remove the line from zcash.conf to prevent the wallet from rescanning every time it is opened and close ZecWallet as normal. How to perform a reindex A reindex is sometimes required when the blockchain data becomes corrupted or you wish to enable certain features. When a reindex happens the full blockchain is redownloaded so it will take some time to complete and should only be performed where absolutely necessary. To complete a reindex simply follow the instruction for a wallet rescan replacing -rescan with -reindex . zcashd -reindex Unknown Errors If you are seeing Unknown Error error messages, your Zcash params may have become corrupt, and ZecWallet or zcashd are having trouble. You should delete the zcash params directory and restart ZecWallet. Delete all the files under these directories: Windows: %HOMEPATH%\\AppData\\Roaming\\ZcashParams\\ macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams/ Linux: ~/.zcash-params/ Large Download The params files together are about 1.7GB in size, so your download may take a while ZecWallet will then re-download the params files when restarted. The displayed balance is incorrect If your balance is not being correctly displayed, first ensure that your software is up to date and that your node is fully synced. If your balance is still incorrect you can perform a manual wallet rescan which will rescan the blockchain for missing wallet transactions on startup. Depending on the number of (shielded) addresses in the wallet, this can be (very) slow so just leave it running until complete and your balance should be reflected accurately. Common error messages Could not start embedded zcashd This means ZecWallet couldn t start its embedded zcashd for some reason. ZecWallet will show you another dialog box with the error reported from zcashd for debugging purposes as well. You might be able to solve this by simply restarting ZecWallet, but if you repeatedly see this error, it might be one of the following reasons: If you compiled ZecWallet yourself and are running it: zcashd doesn t come with the GitHub repository, so you ll have to compile zcashd separately and copy it over into your ZecWallet directory. You might have corrupt zcash params: In this case, you may try deleting your params and letting ZecWallet download them again. If all else fails, you can run an external zcashd and ZecWallet will connect to it. Authentication error Normally, ZecWallet can pick up the rpcuser/rpcpassword from zcash.conf . If it doesn t for some reason, you can set the username/password in the File- Settings menu. If you are connecting to a remote node, make sure that zcashd on the remote machine is accepting connections from your machine. The target machine s firewall needs to allow connections from your host and also zcashd is set to be configured to accept connections from this host. Using the RPC port over a remote interface is NOT RECOMMENDED Using the RPC port over a remote interface is NOT RECOMMENDED, because that will cause the rpcpassword to be transmitted over the network unencrypted, allowing any observer to steal your keys and take over the OS account running zcashd. Not enough balance when sending transactions The most likely cause for this is that you are trying to spend unconfirmed funds. Unlike Bitcoin, the Zcash protocol doesn t let you spent unconfirmed funds. Wait for at least one confirmation and then retry the transaction.

If you are concerned, then wait until the official RPC tool is released into zcashd before migrating funds. Turnstile Migration overview The Sapling turnstile is an auditing mechanism for the number of ZEC in circulation. The Sapling turnstile provides accounting for the ZEC held in Sprout shielded addresses as they are migrated to Sapling shielded addresses. To achieve this, owners of shielded ZEC are required to send their balances to a transparent address before sending to Sapling shielded addresses. If you simply send the funds from a Sprout address to a transparent address and onwards to a Sapling address it would be relatively trivial to link the balances. ZecWallet can migrate your Sprout funds to a Sapling address in a privacy-preserving manner following the privacy recommendations by: Creating new transparent addresses in your wallet to move from Sprout to transparent addresses. Splits the funds across multiple transparent addresses over multiple blocks. Uses round numbers to obscure any identifying information as these round number values, e.g. 10 will be very common in the blockchain. Using the turnstile tool To start the turnstile migration tool, open it by choosing Apps- Sapling Turnstile and choose the Sprout address (zc) to migrate funds from and the Sapling address (zs) to send funds too in addition to the number of days you would like to migrate the funds over. Generally, increasing the option to migrate over a larger number of blocks is the preferred solution but note that there will be an increase in the number of transactions, all of which require a fee. The migrate over 4 days (2304 blocks) requires 10 transactions resulting in fees of 0.001 ZEC for the migration. Note that you may only perform one migration at a time using the app. Closing the wallet during the migration. If you shut down the wallet, then it ll send any pending transactions on reopening, which may result in the undesired behaviour of multiple transactions occurring back-to-back. The wallet must be open for any transactions to be sent so you should open it frequently and preferably leave it open throughout. To check on the progress of the turnstile at any time, visit Apps- Sapling Turnstile and you will be presented with the migration progress and the number of blocks until the next transaction. Backup your wallet.dat file after starting the migration. ZecWallet creates new transparent addresses for the turnstile migration. You must create a backup after confirming the migration to ensure you have the private keys for these intermediate transparent addresses in case there is an issue.

These parameters are currently around 1.7GB in size and only need to be downloaded once. Now that you have ZecWallet installed it is time to start using the software. If you are using the embedded zcashd and it is your first time using the software, the system parameters will be downloaded from the internet (~1.7GB) and a zcash.conf file created specifying some default configuration values. The blockchain will then begin to sync, which is a time-consuming process taking anywhere of the order of 8 hours to days depending on your hardware and network performance. You can monitor the progress in the bottom right corner of ZecWallet which displays the number of blocks downloaded and a sync percentage. Initial Sync The blockchain is around 22GB in size and will take around 8+ hours to download. Monitor the progress via the sync progress in the bottom right corner of ZecWallet. Video : Verifying node synchronization Generating a new address Visiting the Receive tab of ZecWallet will show all current addresses in the wallet and enable you to generate new ones. To learn about the different types of addresses available in Zcash which are transparent, shielded (Sprout and Sapling) please visit this page . It is not possible to remove an address from the wallet once it has been generated. Backup after generating a new address Whenever a new address is generated you should ensure that you have a backup of the address. Only Sapling uses a HD wallet and can be recreated from a seed whereas transparent or Sprout addresses either require the private key or a wallet.dat backup made after the address was created. See the Backing up section for more details. Transparent addresses are automatically created when clicking the t-Addr button as transparent addresses should not be reused. Unlike transparent addresses, it is fine to reuse shielded addresses and so new addresses can be manually created on-demand via the New Address button. Optionally, add a label to easily identify the address and add it to your address book. A QR code is also provided for the address which may be used to scan into a compatible application to receive funds. ZecWallet will also show if the address has been previously used. Video : Receive a Transaction Sending a transaction Once you ve generated an address and have sent some funds to it, you can send some ZEC. Click on the Send tab: You can only send funds with at least one confirmation. While transactions are being confirmed, they are easily identifiable as they are highlighted in red. Choose an address with funds in it and enter the recipient address. You may specify multiple recipients per transaction, and there may be a mixture of transparent and shielded recipients. The Memo field is only available when sending to a shielded address (either Sprout or Sapling). The default mining fee is 0.0001 ZEC which is recommended for all transactions. See the Options section if you wish to customise this behaviour and understand the implications. Shielded send requirements Sending Sapling transaction require little resource usage and happen in a few seconds. If you still have funds in legacy Sprout addresses sending times are typically around 70-90 seconds and require an additional 1.3GB of memory to perform the spend. Video : Send a Transaction Viewing transaction on explorer Once complete, the txid will be displayed. Right-click to bring up a menu to view on a block explorer. Alternatively, for any transactions on the Transactions tab right click and choose View on block explorer . This will open up the transaction on a block explorer . If your transaction is a shielded one there will not be any public information available except the fee paid. Pay Zcash URI You can enter a Zcash URI by visiting File- Pay Zcash URI and pasting in the payment link. Zcash payment URIs encode the address, amount and memo into a single convenient string, so you can enter it into ZecWallet and make payments easily. Address book The address book makes managing addresses and labels simple. Either select Address Book in the application menu or select the button on the Send tab. You can import an address book in csv format and users of WinZEC can import an existing address book . Video : Using Labels Payment Requests ZecWallet lets you request Zcash payments using shielded transactions. Select File- Request Zcash and enter the Sapling address of the user you are requesting Zcash from, along with the amount and an optional memo. The payment request is sent to the user s Sapling address as a memo. The user can right-click and choose View Payment Request from the context menu and selects Pay to send the payment to the designated address. Backing up ZecWallet provides multiple options to ensure your wallet and keys are backed up. It is important that you perform regular backups if you are not exclusively using Sapling addresses and have the Sapling seed. While Sapling has a HD wallet , support for importing the seed is not yet available. It is not yet possible to import a Sapling HD seed While Sapling provides a HD wallet the feature for importing the seed does not yet exist, so while your funds would not be lost in the situation where you have the seed they would be rendered unusable until this feature is added. Therefore it is recommended you keep regular backups of either private keys or the wallet.dat file until this feature is implemented. Export a single private key To export a single private key on the Balance tab right click on the address and choose Get private key from the context menu. Alternatively, on the Receive tab choose the address in question and click the Export Private Key . The output of both is the private key which you can copy to a secure storage medium or be used to import into other applications. Export all private keys You can export all private keys for addresses in your wallet by choosing the File- Export all private keys menu option. This will provide a list of all private keys in the wallet. Note that by default when zcashd starts it creates 100 transparent addresses for the keypool for use as change addresses, hence this list will always contain at least 100 transparent address keys, not all of which have been used. Video : Exporting private keys Backing up wallet.dat You can backup all of your private keys by making a copy of the wallet.dat file. To restore, you then replace any existing wallet.dat file in the data directory and start ZecWallet as normal. Create a new backup after each new address generated As new addresses are generated you will need to create an updated backup, else the new private keys will not be included. While this is a convenient method of backing up, it means that you are restricted to importing to software compatible with zcashd and also if you have many addresses that are unused it will slow rescanning of the wallet over importing only your addresses with funds. Importing private keys To import a private key, choose File- Import private key from the menu. You may paste in multiple keys, one per line that will be imported into the wallet. Note that depending on the number of keys to import and if they are shielded addresses it may take some time for the import to be completed. Video : Import private keys ZecWallet options ZecWallet has a number of options that allow you to customise how the application behaves and may be accessed in the Settings- Options menu as shown below. Remember shielded transactions By default zcashd will not store information about your outgoing fully shielded transactions (z- z). If this option is selected, ZecWallet will store outgoing transactions locally so that any shielded spends will appear in the transactions tab. If you do not wish these transactions to be saved by ZecWallet simply toggle the option for Remember shielded transactions . At any point, you may clear your shielded transaction history locally by choosing the Clear History button (there is no way of recovering this data once cleared). Allow custom fees Choose this option to allow the ability to change the default 0.0001 ZEC transaction fee. As all fees are transparent, it is highly recommended that you use the default fee for all transactions, to make your transactions indistinguishable. Shield change to your Sapling address Like Bitcoin, when using transparent addresses, change from a transaction goes to a new transparent address which can lead to your funds being spread over multiple addresses. ZecWallet allows you to set an option to automatically send this change to a Sapling address via the Shield change from t-Addresses to your sapling address option. This was implemented in Bitcoin (and inherited in Zcash transparent addresses) as a privacy measure to prevent trivial linking of transactions on the blockchain so shielded (z) addresses do not have this property and any change is returned to the sending (z) address. Connect via TOR When using Zcash it does nothing to preserve your network level privacy so a unique IP address can allow network observers to correlate your Zcash transactions with each other and with your other traffic. To overcome this, you may use TOR to obfuscate your IP address. You will first need to have TOR installed which you may do from the official site . You will need to download and run the TOR Expert Bundle (not the TOR browser). TOR is also available on all popular package managers, e.g. macOS brew install tor or Debian apt install tor . Once running, choose the option in ZecWallet to Connect via TOR and the following line will be added to your zcash.conf file to configure TOR usage proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 . Restart ZecWallet to enable the service running over TOR. Use the advanced options when installing ZecWallet to run zcashd over TOR from the initial startup, so your IP is never exposed to the network. Parameters are not currently downloaded over TOR The Zcash parameters that are downloaded on the first launch are not done so over TOR, depending on your network configuration. Onion Nodes You can connect to Zcash nodes only behind onion addresses by adding the following into your zcash.conf file, which will ensure that your IP address is not exposed to any Zcash-related services when running ZecWallet. proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 onlynet=onion Then provide a list of onion nodes to connect to.

As the transaction is encrypted on the blockchain only the recipient of the transaction can read the memo. This could, for example, be used to include information about the sender for a purchase or a refund address and there is more detail about potential uses of this field in this blog post . You can only include a memo when sending to a shielded address. To include a memo in a transaction, click the Memo button and it will provide a textbox allowing you to enter 512 characters. Video : Using the encrypted memo field Including a reply-to address If you want to send a reply-to address in the memo field, for example, if you are using the memo field as an encrypted chat application, ZecWallet allows you to include a reply-to address in a standard format. To use, press the Include Reply Address and the sending address will automatically be inserted. Replying to a memo If you receive a transaction with a memo that contains a reply address , you can reply to it directly from the transactions table. Simply right-click the transaction and choose Reply to xxx . Exporting transactions ZecWallet allows you to export all transactions via the File- Export Transactions menu item. You will be prompted where to store the exported file and it will be saved as a csv file with the following headers: Type Address Date/Time Amount Memo receive zs123 Sun Feb 17 13:42:38 2019 10 ZEC I am a secret memo Apps ZecWallet bundles some applications to make common tasks simpler. Using z-board.net z-board.net is a message board based on the encrypted memo field . When using shielded addresses messages are anonymous. ZecWallet integrates with the z-board.net service by allowing you to choose topics and post to the correct address without manually adding it. Video : Posting to z-board.net Turnstile migration See the page on the turnstile migration for full details. Customising zcash.conf The zcash.conf file may be used to customise how the underlying zcashd software behaves. There are many configuration options available . When ZecWallet is installed it creates this file with sensible defaults such as connecting to the mainnet and a random rpcpassword. The location of zcash.conf varies by system. It is located in the following location on each platform: Windows: %HOMEPATH%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Zcash\\zcash.conf macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Zcash/zcash.conf Linux: ~/.zcash/zcash.conf Connecting to an external zcashd If you have an external zcashd running ZecWallet will attempt to connect to it automatically. If this fails you can manually set the required settings via the Edit- Settings menu item and specifying the connection details in the zcashd connection tab. Note that the easiest way to connect to a remote node is to SSH to it with port forwarding: ssh -L8232:127.0.0.1:8232 user@remotehost You can disable the embedded zcashd and force ZecWallet to only connect to an external node by starting ZecWallet with the -no-embedded option. Exposing RPC port Using the RPC port over a remote interface is NOT RECOMMENDED, because that will cause the rpcpassword to be transmitted over the network unencrypted, allowing any observer to steal your keys and Zcash, and take over the OS account running zcashd. FastSync If you are running ZecWallet for the first time and don t have an existing zcashd node, the first thing ZecWallet will do is configure your zcash.conf and download the blockchain to do the initial sync. This can be a very time consuming process, and ZecWallet can speed it up for you by doing a fast sync . During a fast sync, ZecWallet s embedded zcashd skips some expensive checks for blocks (Specifically, it skips various checks for Transactions in a block), speeding up the initial sync by 25% - 33%, and since you don t have a wallet yet, you are probably OK skipping these expensive checks in order to get a faster initial sync. The checks are skipped only during initial block download and only up to the highest checkpoint available. Once you have caught up to the zcash blockchain, or pass the highest available checkpoint, all checks are resumed as usual. The Fast Sync is enabled by default if this is the first time you are launching ZecWallet and ZecWallet can t find an existing zcashd. Fast Sync is only available via the embedded zcashd. It is not available if you are running an external zcashd.","title":"Using ZecWallet"},{"location":"using-zecwallet/#using-zecwallet","text":"","title":"Using ZecWallet"},{"location":"using-zecwallet/#getting-started","text":"Initial Parameters Download The first time ZecWallet starts it will create a zcash.conf file with default configuration values as well as downloading the parameters required for sending and validating shielded transactions. These parameters are currently around 1.7GB in size and only need to be downloaded once. Now that you have ZecWallet installed it is time to start using the software. If you are using the embedded zcashd and it is your first time using the software, the system parameters will be downloaded from the internet (~1.7GB) and a zcash.conf file created specifying some default configuration values. The blockchain will then begin to sync, which is a time-consuming process taking anywhere of the order of 8 hours to days depending on your hardware and network performance. You can monitor the progress in the bottom right corner of ZecWallet which displays the number of blocks downloaded and a sync percentage.

To learn about the different types of addresses available in Zcash which are transparent, shielded (Sprout and Sapling) please visit this page . It is not possible to remove an address from the wallet once it has been generated. Backup after generating a new address Whenever a new address is generated you should ensure that you have a backup of the address. Only Sapling uses a HD wallet and can be recreated from a seed whereas transparent or Sprout addresses either require the private key or a wallet.dat backup made after the address was created. See the Backing up section for more details. Transparent addresses are automatically created when clicking the t-Addr button as transparent addresses should not be reused. Unlike transparent addresses, it is fine to reuse shielded addresses and so new addresses can be manually created on-demand via the New Address button. Optionally, add a label to easily identify the address and add it to your address book. A QR code is also provided for the address which may be used to scan into a compatible application to receive funds. ZecWallet will also show if the address has been previously used.

The Memo field is only available when sending to a shielded address (either Sprout or Sapling). The default mining fee is 0.0001 ZEC which is recommended for all transactions. See the Options section if you wish to customise this behaviour and understand the implications.
