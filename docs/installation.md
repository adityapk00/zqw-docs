## zcashd

zec-qt-wallet needs a [Zcash node](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/user_guide.html#installation) running `zcashd`. If you already have a `zcashd` node running, zec-qt-wallet will connect to it. 

If you don't have one running, zec-qt-wallet will start its embedded `zcashd` node. 

Additionally, if this is the first time you're running zec-qt-wallet or a `zcashd` daemon, zec-qt-wallet will download the Zcash params (~1.7 GB) and configure `zcash.conf` for you. 

!!! tip "Disable embedded `zcashd`"
    To force disabling the embedded `zcashd` and only connect to a remote node pass `--no-embedded` to the startup command.

### System requirements

If using the embedded `zcashd` the [recommended system requirements](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/user_guide.html#getting-started) are 5GB of free RAM and 25GB of free disk (the size of the blockchain increases over time).

## Compiling from source
zec-qt-wallet is written in C++ 14, and can be compiled with g++/clang++/visual c++. It also depends on Qt5, which you can get from [here](https://www.qt.io/download). Note that if you are compiling from source, you won't get the embedded `zcashd` by default. You can either run an external `zcashd`, or [compile `zcashd`](/setting-up-build-env/#compiling-zcashd-for-embedded-zcashd) as well. 

See the instructions for [setting up a build environment](/setting-up-build-env) and detailed build instructions for each platform [here](/compile-from-source).

## Upgrading

It is important to keep your version of zec-qt-wallet up to date as new features are regularly added and bugs fixed. To download follow the [instructions to install](/installation/#download-and-install) as your data directory and wallet will be untouched throughout. 

!!! warning "`zcashd` reaches end of service halt after 16 weeks"
    If you are using the embedded `zcashd` then after 16 weeks from release `zcashd` will reach an end of service halt and will shut down. Simply update your version of `zec-qt-wallet` to continue as it will contain updated releases of `zcashd`.

zec-qt-wallet also has an update notifier that will notify you if there's a new release of zec-qt-wallet available.
